# Hawkes + DIAG Model

The model implemented here is similar to the HMHP model but, the key difference in this model is the topic-topic interaction is a diagonal matrix. i.e. the a parent event with topic *k* influences or triggers a child event with the same topic *k*.


_The instructions to execute the code here are similar to that described for HMHP Model (hmhpCode folder in this repo)_.
