2. *Baselines* contains the code for variants of Network Hawkes Process model (i.e. models for with and without content).
3. *inputFiles* contains the files that are required to run each of the models.
4. *synthetic_data_generation_pkg* contains the code for generation of synthetic data as per the HMHP model.
