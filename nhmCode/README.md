# Network Hawkes Model (NHM) 

The NHM model implemented here is similar to Network Hawkes Model described in [Discovering Latent Network Structure in Point Process Data](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/linderman14.pdf). 

The instructions to execute the code here are similar to that described for HMHP Model (hmhpCode folder in this repo).
